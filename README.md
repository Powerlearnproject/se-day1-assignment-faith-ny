Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and tools to aid the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
-It's importance is that it enables creation of software applications and sytems that power aspects of life like finance and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Origins and assembly language in the 1950s - it emerged allowing programmers to write instructions directly for the computers hardware.
2. Structered Programming in the 1960s - concepts like modularity and decision structures improved code quality.
3. Agile development in the 1980s - methodologies like Srum and XP emphasized customer collaboration improving code reusability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - involves gathering user needs and system requirements.
2. Design - involves creating detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation - involves writing code and building the software according to design.
4. Testing - conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards.
5. Deployment - releasing the software to users.
6. Maintenance - providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements after deploying.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- waterfall methodology is linear and sequential while agile methodology is iterative and flexible process.
- there is a risk due to lack of early testing in waterfall while in agile methodology,there is a low risk since testing happens in iteration.
- waterfall methodology would be used in building a bridge since it requires the foundation,structure and the final product.
- agile methodology would be used in creating a mobile app since it may change due to user feedback hence flexible.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. Project Manager - Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. An IDE is a software application that provides tools to help developers write, edit, test, and debug code efficiently.Eg-Visual studio code,eclipse for java and c++
2. A VCS tracks changes to code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate without losing progress.Eg-git,Subversion
   

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Tight project timelines can lead to stress and poor-quality work. You can overcome this by using Agile methodologies to break projects into smaller tasks.
2. New programming languages, frameworks, and tools emerge constantly which can feel overwhelming. You can overcome this by folowing tech blogs, forums, and online courses
3. Handling Technical Debt - Follow best coding practices and write clean code.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  -Unit Testing is testing individual components of software.It is important because it catches bugs early in development.
  - Integration Testing is testing interactions between different components or subsystems. It is important because it identifies communication issues between different parts of the software.
  - System Testing is testing the entire software system as a whole.Ensures the software behaves correctly in a real-world environment.
  - Acceptance Testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.Verifies that the product is ready for launch.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to achieve accurate, relevant, and optimized responses from AI models, such as ChatGPT.
- It improves Efficiency & Saves Time,Enhances AI Accuracy & Relevance


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

-Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about finance."
-Improved Prompt:
"Explain the basics of personal finance, including budgeting, saving, and investing, in simple terms with examples."
-the improved prompt is more effective because it is more specific and has clearer expectations which gives a more useful answer.
